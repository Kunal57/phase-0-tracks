# OPERATION PUPPY EXPLOSION!

# Talk about Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
# Taking relational data (tables that are related to
# each other through primary and foreign keys) and use it in an object oriented language like Ruby. Basically how do
# we make this data in sql and table format useful in a 
# scripting language like Ruby or Python. 

# Require gems
# A gem is pre-written ruby that you can simply require (Ex: Rspec).
require 'sqlite3'
require 'faker'

# Create SQLite3 database
db = SQLite3::Database.new("puppies.db")

# Learn about fancy string delimiters

# Create a puppy table (if it's not there already)

# Add a test kitten

# Explore ORM by retrieving data

# Add LOOOOTS of puppies!
# SO. MANY. PUPPIES.
