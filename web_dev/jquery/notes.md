# jQuery

### Action Plan

- Complete the 5 Units of jQuery on Code Academy
- Google any concepts that aren't clear
- Test the lessons learned in the unit on the Chrome Console
- Build a small piece of a jQuery Project after each lesson
- Build upon the jQuery Project with each lesson

### Effective Strategies

Code Academy was a great place to learn jQuery. It introduced me to the JavaScript library and provided implementation techniques as well as experimentation opportunities to test my knowledge. Along with Code Academy, I also implemented jQuery on my own website for additional practice. I believe this technique of utilizing Code Academy and experimenting with jQuery on my own site helped me understand and implement jQuery to help make websites more dynamic. 

### jQuery Project

My jQuery Project was a simple feature to help make my website more dynamic. My original site consisted of a header with additional navigation links below it. Instead of having static elements, I decided to make each element more dynamic by having them change colors when a user hovered over them. I utilized jQuery and used the 'mouseover' and 'mouseleave' events to help toggle the color every time a user hovered over the elements. I could have also used the 'hover' event to do the same. Along with the hover feature, I also experimented with adding and removing elements, rearranging elements, and adding classes to elements in my 'script.js' file.
